==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. The train data and the test data have also been merged to be one data set included in the "train+test" folder

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'train+test/subjectid_activity_variables.txt': All set. 
    - subjectid column: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
    - activitytype column: activities the subject was taking.
    - all the left columns are features (refer to features.txt file.) Only mean() variable and std() variables are kept, refer to features_info.txt 

- 'train+test/average_per_variable_per_activity_per_subject.txt': average of each variable(only mean() and std() are considered) for each activity and each subject.


The files inside the 'train+test' are obtained by merging 'train' folder and 'test' folder, which can be found in the original data file: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Methods to tidy the original 'train' and 'test' data and generate the files inside the 'train+test':
==========================================================================================
- 'run_analysis.R' code is used to tidy the data set and generate tidy data sets in 'train+test'; details can be found inside README.md


Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
